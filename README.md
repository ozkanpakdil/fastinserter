# Coding Assignment 2
This was a code assignment from `Credit Suisse Bank`, I got the job at 2017 and worked until 2020, now this is public, because there is no more Credit Suisse

Requirements
* Java 8
* Use of any open-source library is allowed
* Program must use gradle build system to resolve dependencies, build and test

# Summary

Our custom-build server logs different events to a file. Every event has 2 entries in log - one entry when the event was started and another when
the event was finished. The entries in log file have no specific order (it can happen that finish event is logged before event start)
Every line in the file is a JSON object containing event data:
* id - the unique event identifier
* state - whether the event was started or finished (can have values "STARTED" or "FINISHED")
* timestamp - the timestamp of the event in milliseconds

Application Server logs also have the additional attributes:
* type - type of log
* host - hostname
Example:
```
{"id":"scsmbstgra", "state":"STARTED", type:"APPLICATION_LOG",
host:"12345", "timestamp":1491377495212}
{"id":"scsmbstgrb", "state":"STARTED", "timestamp":1491377495213}
{"id":"scsmbstgrc", "state":"FINISHED", "timestamp":1491377495218}
{"id":"scsmbstgra", "state":"FINISHED", type:"APPLICATION_LOG",
host:"12345", "timestamp":1491377495217}
{"id":"scsmbstgrc", "state":"STARTED", "timestamp":1491377495210}
{"id":"scsmbstgrb", "state":"FINISHED", "timestamp":1491377495216}
```
In the example above, the event scsmbstgrb duration is 1491377495216 - 1491377495213 = 3ms
The longest event is scsmbstgrc (1491377495218 -1491377495210 = 8ms)

# The program should:

Take the input file path as input argument
Flag any long events that take longer that 4ms with a column in the database called "alert".
Write the found event details to mysql
The application should create new table if necessary enter the following values:
Event id
Event duration
Type and Host if applicable
"alert" true is applicable

# Additional points will be granted for:

* Proper use of info and debug logging
* Proper use of Object Oriented programming
* Unit tests coverage
* Multi-threaded solution
* Program that can handle very large files (gigabytes)

# How to run solution

How to run spring boot application
```
./gradlew bootRun -Pargs=example.data.json
```
for big json file
```
./gradlew bootRun -Pargs=sample.json -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs="-Xmx4g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication"
```
Test Result
Chunk size :10000 jsonsize:8gb 100000000lines took 36m

running faster solution
```
./gradlew -PmainClass=FasterSolution -Pargs=sample.json execute 
```
latest test with 8gb file took 33m. 
```
./gradlew -PmainClass=EPTFAssignment.solver.FasterSolution -Pargs=sample.json execute -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs="-Xmx4g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication"
```
generating sample data
```
./gradlew -PmainClass=data.generator.GenerateSampleJson execute -Pargs=100000000 -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs="-Xmx4g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication"
```

latest test : 40000000 objects inserted in 2m 40s
